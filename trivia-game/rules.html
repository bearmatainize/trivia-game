                <h3>Overview:</h3>
                <p class="rules-paragraph">
                    You want to collect three different colored crystals before anyone else in this Trivia Adventure.
                    You move around the board, then answer trivia questions to gain coins to spend on buying crystals, or stealing them from your rivals.
                    There are also items to help you beat your rivals.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Setup:</h3>
                <ul class="rules-list">
                    <li>Set out the game board</li>
                    <li>Place the crystals in the center of the buying/stealing area</li>
                    <li>Place the items at the opposite corner of the board in the shop</li>
                    <li>Put all the coins in the center of the board, this will act as your bank</li>
                    <li>Each player picks a color, and takes their character, tokens, answer pyramid, and die of that color</li>
                    <li>Place all selected characters at the start</li>
                    <li>Put all extra pieces to the side, or back in the box</li>
                    <li>Roll the normal white die to see who goes first, then begin play clockwise from the highest roller</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Objective:</h3>
                <p class="rules-paragraph">
                    The game ends at the end of the round of turns where at least one player gets three different colored crystals.
                     So, if the first player achieves this, the rest of the players still take their turn before ending the game.
                     This allows the other players to steal a crystal away or get the last crystal they need.
                     If there are multiple players with one of each crystal by the end of the round of turns, the player with the most coins wins.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Spaces:</h3>
                <ul class="rules-list">
                    <li>Blue Space: Collect 3 coins if landed on - Take from the bank</li>
                    <li>Red Space: Lose 3 coins if landed on - Give to the bank</li>
                    <li>Green Space: Teleport to the other green space if landed on</li>
                    <li>Yellow Space: Can Buy/Steal a crystal if landed on or passed</li>
                    <ul class="rules-list-list">
                        <li>Buy: Give the bank 20 coins in exchange for any colored crystal still available</li>
                        <li>Steal: Give the bank 40 coins in exchange for any colored crystal another player has</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Arrows:</h3>
                <p class="rules-paragraph">
                    The arrows do not count as spaces when you move around the board, so make sure you arenâ€™t counting them!
                    When you pass an arrow you can do whatever action it allows:
                </p>
                <ul class="rules-list-indent">
                    <li>Multi Direction Arrow: Pick which way to go!</li>
                    <li>Shop Arrow: Go ahead and buy whichever items you want, remember you can only have 2 in your hand at once</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Items and Shop:</h3>
                <p class="rules-paragraph">
                    You can buy 4 different items from the shop to help you win.
                    They are all 10 coins each.
                    You can only ever have 2 items in your hand at once, and can use only one item at the start of your turn.
                    You can have as many items on the board as you want.
                    When placing items on the board, place one of your tokens beneath it to keep track of whose items are whose.
                    The items in the shop are:
                </p>
                <ul class="rules-list-indent">
                    <li>Red Space Items (Red Item): This is a placeable red space, you can put this on any existing uncovered red or blue space on the board. Then, anyone that lands on this space must give the 3 coins they lose to you instead of the bank.</li>
                    <li>Coin Stealer Items (Yellow Item): Every player you pass on this turn must give you 10 of their coins</li>
                    <li>Double Dice Roll Items (White Item): You get to roll two dice! You can choose between rolling your die twice, the normal die twice, or both your die and the normal die.</li>
                    <li>STOP! Items (Black Item): This is a placeable item, you can put this on any existing uncovered red or blue space on the board. Whichever player, other than yourself, next attempts to pass this space instead must stop on this space until their next turn. This also uses the item, and it is removed from the board and goes back into the shop.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>An Example of Play:</h3>
                <p class="rules-paragraph">
                    Each Player takes their turn:
                </p>
                <ul class="rules-list-indent">
                    <li>Choose to use an item if they have one they wish to use</li>
                    <li>Choose to roll their die, or the normal die</li>
                    <li>Roll that chosen die</li>
                    <li>Move that amount of spaces and take any actions along the way</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="rules-paragraph">
                    After every players' turn, Trivia time!:
                </p>
                <ul class="rules-list-indent">
                    <li>Someone reads the next question</li>
                    <li>Everyone places their answer pyramid in the center with their selected answer pointing up at the same time</li>
                    <li>Someone reads the correct answer</li>
                    <li>Everyone that answered correctly gets 10 coins. Those who got it wrong don't lose anything</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
